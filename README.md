üåü Excited to share my journey as an intern at CodSoft! üöÄ

During my internship, I had the opportunity to work on some fascinating machine learning projects:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Movie Genre Prediction**
Developed a machine learning model to predict movie genres based on plot summaries using techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings. Explored classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Credit Card Fraud Detection**
Built a robust model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using datasets containing transaction information. Explored algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Customer Churn Prediction**
Created a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service using historical customer data. Utilized features like usage behavior and demographics, applying algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Spam SMS Detection**
Developed an AI model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate using techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings. Implemented classifiers including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Handwritten Text Generation**
Implemented a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate handwritten-like text. Trained the model on a dataset of handwritten text examples, allowing it to generate new text based on learned patterns.

I'm grateful for the hands-on experience and mentorship at CodSoft, where I've had the chance to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems. Looking forward to continuing to grow and contribute to impactful projects!
